# Graphs

## What is a Graph

- Is a collection of nodes(the vertices) connected by edges
  - Nodes represents entities
  - Edges represent relationships between entities

### Types of Entities
- Directed Graph - one way relationship
- Undirected Graph - two-way relationship
- Weight Graph - edges have values to represent the cost
- Cyclic Graph - if you follow the edges you return to the starting point
- Acyclic Graph - does not contain cycles
- Connected Graph - all nodes are reachable from any node
- Disconnected Graph - contains nodes that are not connected

## What is a Height-Balanced Binary Search Tree
- The difference in height between the left and right subtrees (the balance factor) is kept within a specified range, often limited to 1
- This allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations, as the tree remains relatively balanced even after modifications
