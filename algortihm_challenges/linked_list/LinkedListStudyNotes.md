# What is a LinkedList
- A data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes,
  where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence.

# LinkedList vs Array
### LinkedList Pros
- Dynamic Size
  - Can grow and shrink without requiring preallocation of memory
- Efficient insertions and deletions
  - Adding or removing elements is done in a constant time regardless of the list size

### LinkedList Cons
- Less efficient in random access 
- Requires additional memory to store the pointers

# Array
### Array Pros
- Efficient in random access
- Lower memory compared with linkedlist because don't require the pointer

## Array Cons
- Fixed size
- inefficient insertions and deletions

# Basic idea behind reversing a linked list
- Is to change the direction of the pointers that connect the nodes.
